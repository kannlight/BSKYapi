This can be interpreted as ‘India/Nigeria’s birth rates are the problem’. \n\nIt is much more a problem of growing consumption of the rich minority (most of the UK) due to capitalism as you say in the second part."

For instance methane levels are growing faster than CO2 and top single anthropogenic cause is still meat/dairy consumption. Methane is causing more warming than CO2 over a decade or so. Forest are disappearing, oceans warming & acidifying etc"
