I suspect the morning show preferred to have him do chalk art rather than spray painting graffiti to make him more palatable to the middle class viewers. They need not have torn their hair out over property damage in the Reagan era of America."

Attuned to a sort of gay scene and new wave + hip-hop sensibility translated from music to visual art, it feels like he was living in the 1990s a decade early."

That has shaped the aspects of his work most popularly remembered, and the aspects that are conveniently forgotten by the mainstream."
