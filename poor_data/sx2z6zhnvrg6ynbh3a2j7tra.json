Also, smaller sized maps made spawning a nightmare because of said precision weapon.\n\nLedges were added for accessibility reasons. Instead of having random creases, they added ledges."

Every weapon played an effective role, power ups and power weapons were highly important for map control and movement was your key to success. \n\nHalo 3 and 4 brought in gimmicks that down more harm than good to the sandbox."

That is bad map design because that goes against how the game is meant to be played."
