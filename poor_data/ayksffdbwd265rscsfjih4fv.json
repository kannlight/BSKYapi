Even if you're correct: it's meaningless unless you can compare what the economic outcome would have been if there were no stimulus or restrictions."

You purposely ignoring that in favor of a simplistic narrative and pretending I'm implying math is partisan affirms that you are not a serious person, and now I'm comfortable calling you a partisan hack/troll."
