And this is the coolest design I’ve seen by far, BUT BUT BUT it is still extremely non-trivial to build. It requires you to be pretty good at printing AND very handy with DIY electronics projects."

I’m pretty ok at both these things and I found both parts pretty challenging. \n\nI think it’s probably better to start with an easier design, but ymmv! ❤️🤷‍♂️"
