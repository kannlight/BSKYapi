I guess there was some translating mix-up because the steps are \"3, 2, 1, 4\" etc. Someone went with Western numbering (from top left) while the original starts on the top right. This is so interesting compared to the level of detail in the tutorial itself!"

I love these artefacts because they tell me something about how the text was constructed. Was it a layout template? Did the editor and graphics have different ideas"
