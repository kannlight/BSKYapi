They won, but just like the cookie cutter narcissists they are, they are here looking for supply to project their invalidations onto, and without that supply, they literally start imploding. The two things narcissists hate most are:\n-transparency\n-your personal agency"

The more they perceive to be winning the psychological competition between them and their supply, the greater the dopamine. \nTherefore when engaging them, you must be focused on two things: \n1) manipulating their dopamine hits to your own strategic advantage"
