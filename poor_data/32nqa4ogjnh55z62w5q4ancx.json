It is a project of a group of people and the majority of the population supports it through brainwashing. However, the majority of the population are responsible as well, why do you think their leader can still keep going?"

If you want to only blame one person, how about Herzl who implemented the idea of Zionism...how about that Christian guy in the late 19th century who thought about the project Zionism? They're all already dead. It may start with one person's idea, but it isn't now."
