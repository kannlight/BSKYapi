The opposing view, which I took is that his skill set near ideal for Indy’s offense and critiques of his ability as a runner were about aesthetics not results."

Addai was exactly the kind of runner undervalued by the anti-statgeeks. “He dances too much, his YPC is bad.”But he was fantastic as a blocker/receiver and consistently made positive plays running."
