There literally is no way to prevent this scraping, especially on something with a public protocol like BlueSky has with AT.\n\nThis truly isn't about BlueSky's ethics.  This is entirely about the ethics of other companies."

If they didn’t think something could be done they wouldn’t bother meeting with lawyers and engineers. I hope they think as big as the orgs and artists who have been making strides with litigation."
