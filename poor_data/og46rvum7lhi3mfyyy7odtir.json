These channels have blurred the lines with these pundits who are lawyers, political consultants, politicians, broadcasters and “personalities”. \n\nWhere are the journalists? The reporters? Actual members of the press? \n\nExpertise is taking a backseat."

Respectfully I would add that arguing is not what true journalism is about, it’s investigation, research and presentation of facts."
