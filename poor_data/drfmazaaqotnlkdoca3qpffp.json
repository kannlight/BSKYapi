I used to run two sports Twitter accounts, and, right now, they'd only have a fraction of the engagement here. General Japanese language a/cs are still thin vs Twitter."

There's more chance of Bluesky getting better but there's a 60 second limit on video uploads. Coverage clips of the Haneda crash and Noto quake were generally longer than that."
