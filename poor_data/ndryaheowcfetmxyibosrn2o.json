Really want to do some family history while Iâ€™m there. I know there are relatives on the Pisciotta side but I want to learn more about the Nicolettis."

The first week in Matera my friend and I walked down a flight of stone steps into the old town about 7pm and the bells were ringing. It was so spooky!"

Then, about the 80s, people were encouraged to come back and create liveable homes.  Similar schemes ran in other abandoned Italian villages I believe."
